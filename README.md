# RNN-playground
Repository to play around with different RNN architectures for my thesis on temporal modeling for safer spacecrafts. I'm using python and tensorflow/keras.

## How to use

## Datasets and results
Training on the shakespeare dataset takes more time then I can allow at this moment. After training for two days an accuracy of about 30% was reached. The generated text is therefore nothing impressive. A file with 1000 generated characters can be found in the results folder.
